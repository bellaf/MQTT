Code build note, featured to include, things to be done etc etc..

Ref info:

Wemos Pin assignments for thermostat:

D3 GPIO0: btn_Up
TX GPIO1:
D4 GPIO2: btn_Down
RX GPIO3:
D2 GPIO4: CS (SPI Chip Select)
D1 GPIO5: D/C (SPI Data / Command line)
D6 GPIO12: MISO (SPI)
D7 GPIO13: MOSI (SPI)
D5 GPIO14: SCL (SPI Clock)
D8 GPIO15: Free
D0 GPIO16: Free

Things to do:

- set some button up and down limits for the setpoint, perhaps 10 degrees min, 30 degrees max? (See the example sketches for the
  JC_Button object

- Using GPIO 2 in tandem for the DS1820, as well as the Btn Down ....  might need to inhibit temp reading when the button is in use....

- Added MQTT Publish topic to turn on and off the virtual Heating control relay.....  NB, Topic is Case sensitive....
